# Jore4 test db manager

Jore4 test db manager is intented to be used with e2e/integration tests.
It is implemented as separate package so that it can be used in different situations without direct dependency to `jore4-ui` project.

## Getting started

- Run `yarn build` for building the project. Add `--watch` flag to build automatically when something changes.
- Run `yarn qa` for running the same checks that CI does.
